# CNN-Model-For-Pneumonia-Detection-From-X-ray-Images
Facial expressions serve as visible indicators of various aspects of human behaviour, including affective states, cognitive activities, intentions, and psychopathological conditions. They play a crucial role in interpersonal communication and interaction. Automatic recognition of facial expressions holds significant potential in natural human-machine interfaces, behavioural science research, and clinical practice.

In this project, we propose an automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The CNN model is trained and evaluated using a facial expression dataset containing labelled expressions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and neutrality. However, our system goes beyond traditional facial expression recognition by incorporating real-time emotion feedback functionality.

Using live camera feed, our system not only recognizes and analyses facial emotions in real time but also provides proactive feedback to users based on their detected emotions. For example, if the system detects signs of stress or sadness in the user's facial expression, it can offer calming or uplifting content, such as guided meditation exercises or motivational quotes. This real-time feedback capability enhances the utility and user experience of the system, making it more responsive and empathetic.

By leveraging the power of CNN-based facial expression recognition and real-time emotion feedback, our system aims to facilitate a wide range of applications in human-computer interaction, psychological research, and clinical diagnostics. It represents a significant advancement in the field of emotion recognition technology, with potential implications for improving user well-being and enhancing human-machine interaction.
